# Exercise 2

## How to use

If you have git configure on your machine pls copy the code above:
Download the project [or clone the repo](git@github.com:MDRRicardo/IHC.git):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MDRRicardo/IHC.git
```

If you don't have git configured on your machine, you can download the clone as a zip
and then extract the project.

Install it and run:

Check if you are using version 18 of the node:
```bash
node --version
```
If you are not on version 18, install version 18. One solution is to install nvm. After installing
nvm just use:

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

When everything is configured, simply install the project dependencies with the command below:
Note: Remembering that they need to be within the project directory
```bash
yarn
```

And then start the project
```bash
yarn dev
```
